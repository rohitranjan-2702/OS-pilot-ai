# Contribute to OpenSource with the help of AI.

We oftenly find some good open source projects out there, from which we want to learn, explore the techstack they are using, sometimes even make a useful contribution. But sometimes it's very overwhelming for us to setup the code locally, understand the whole code on our own and many such hurdles in between.

That's why we built OS Pilot, which will guide you through the codebase and help you explore the project so damn easily. You can ask anything you want regarding the codebase.
